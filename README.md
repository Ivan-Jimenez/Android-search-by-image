# Search By Image 
The idea of the project is find information about important landmarks around the world just by taking a photo of them.
This application uses the Google Cloud Vision API for this task.

This what I got so far
-----------
Detects the landmark froma a given image 
-----------
<img src="screenshots/shot1.png" height="534" width="300"/>
------------
Shows the Wikipedia search for the image
------------
<img src="screenshots/shot2.png" height="534" width="300"/>
------------
Landmark's location
---------------
<img src="screenshots/shot3.png" height="534" width="300"/>
